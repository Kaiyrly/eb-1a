His résumé \ExhibitRef{Resume} and diplomas \ExhibitRef{Diploma1}\ExhibitRef{Diploma2} are included. Across roles, he has delivered (i) omnichannel civic-service platforms, (ii) election-grade address/registry data pipelines, (iii) national cyber-operations tooling, (iv) computer-vision deployments at city scale and (v) enterprise digitalization programs.

\medskip
\noindent\textbf{How the evidence meets the USCIS criteria (at a glance).}

\smallskip
\noindent\textbf{Criterion 1 — Awards (national/governmental and industry).}
Named governmental commendations include a \emph{Presidential Letter of Appreciation} for organizing the SCO summit (2024) \SectionRef{subsubsec:PresSCO2024} and a \emph{Presidential Letter of Appreciation} for the 2022 extraordinary election \SectionRef{subsubsec:PresElection2022}; mayoral commendations \SectionRef{subsubsec:AkimKurmet2022}\SectionRef{subsubsec:AkimAlgys2022}; and an international-vendor certificate from \textbf{Kaspersky} recognizing cybersecurity leadership \SectionRef{subsubsec:KasperskyThanks2022} (see \SectionRef{subsec:Awards}). In addition, the portfolio records the national \textbf{“Bolashak” Presidential Scholarship} funding graduate study at UCL (substantial, government-funded award), which is documented and tied to his later IT work (\SectionRef{subsubsec:Bolashak2013}).

\smallskip
\noindent\textbf{Criterion 2 — Association membership requiring outstanding achievements.}
By signed/ sealed Council decision, \mrl{} was admitted to the \textbf{Kazakhstan Information Security Association (KISA)}, which applies achievement-based requirements and expert vetting \SectionRef{subsubsec:AssociationsKISA} (\SectionRef{subsec:Associations}).

\smallskip
\noindent\textbf{Criterion 3 — Published material about the person.}
Professional/major media published feature pieces \emph{about} his leadership of city digital platforms, with outlet credibility and translations provided (\SectionRef{subsec:Published}).

\smallskip
\noindent\textbf{Criterion 4 — Judge of the work of others.}
He serves as a permanent university reviewer (AIU; ENU) \SectionRef{subsubsec:JudgingAIU}\SectionRef{subsubsec:JudgingENU}, an expert/jury member for national programs (ITeachMe/OrleTECH) \SectionRef{subsubsec:JudgingITeachMeNew} and sits on expert commissions for Kaspersky, the city situation center, the national cyber operator STS and others, issuing written adopt/revise/reject conclusions (\SectionRef{subsubsec:JudgingKasperskyNew}\SectionRef{subsubsec:JudgingIKomek}\SectionRef{subsubsec:JudgingSTS}; see \SectionRef{subsec:Judging}).

\smallskip
\noindent\textbf{Criterion 5 — Original contributions of major significance.}
Independent officials and technical leaders document original platforms/architectures with measurable outcomes: \textit{omnichannel CRM/automation}; \textit{election registry pipelines} (accuracy improved to \(\,100\%\)); \textit{national cyber platforms} (\emph{Synaq}, \emph{ScanKZ}, a closed media-monitoring bot); \textit{600\(+\)}–camera computer vision; \textit{“Life Signal’’} emergency telematics; and \textit{wireless geophone arrays} (\SectionRef{subsec:Contributions}).

\smallskip
\noindent\textbf{Criterion 6 — Authorship of scholarly/professional articles.}
\mrl{} authored \textbf{10\(+\)} articles in smart-city analytics, municipal data engineering, open-data/APIs and civic IT productization. Six representative items show scholarly apparatus (UDC/DOI, abstracts/keywords, references) and placement in professional, VAK-listed venues; program pages/certificates and proceedings metadata are provided (\SectionRef{subsec:Articles}).

\smallskip
\noindent\textbf{Criterion 7 — Comparable evidence (public display).}
Because artistic exhibitions do not readily apply to STEM product/program leadership, the record provides \emph{comparable} evidence: curated conference presentations of \mrls own technical work, publicly shown and archived in citable proceedings (\SectionRef{subsec:Display}).

\smallskip
\noindent\textbf{Criterion 8 — Leading or critical roles.}
Leading/critical roles are documented at \textbf{distinguished organizations}: modernization of the city situation center and election-registry accuracy (Akimat/iKOMEK109) \SectionRef{subsubsec:LetterBaiken}\SectionRef{subsubsec:LetterBeisenbayev}; daily-used national cyber platforms and board-level governance at \textbf{JSC “State Technical Service’’} \SectionRef{subsubsec:LetterSTS}; cross-agency computer-vision operations \SectionRef{subsubsec:LetterPanchenko}; and enterprise digitalization at EQK \SectionRef{subsubsec:JudgingEQK}.

\smallskip
\noindent\textbf{Criterion 9 — High salary.}
Signed payroll/contract records establish \textbf{combined 2024 gross remuneration} (municipal enterprise \(+\) STS) of \(\mathbf{40{,}858{,}987.91}\)~KZT, exceeding Astana 2024 benchmarks from independent surveys/letters (HR~Praktika, HeadHunter, RecCom). Currency conversions at National Bank of Kazakhstan rates are tabulated in \SectionRef{subsec:Salary}.

\medskip
\noindent\textbf{Flagship programs referenced throughout (orientation).}
\emph{City platform, generation 1 — iKOMEK109.} The capital’s 24/7 monitoring \& rapid-response center (short code “109”, mobile app, online channels) with continuous CCTV operations, SOC practices and analytics-backed incident response used for major events and daily city services.\\
\emph{City platform, generation 2 — iKOMEK~2.0.} The modernized, data-driven evolution emphasizing automation, dashboards/analytics, registry hygiene and omnichannel intake; presented across industry forums and reflected in the contributions/leadership evidence.%

\bigskip
\noindent\textbf{Conclusion.} Cross-referenced to sections and exhibits, the record demonstrates that \mrl{} satisfies \textbf{Criteria 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 (comparable evidence), 8 and 9}. The through-line is consistent: end-to-end product/program leadership for mission-critical civic platforms, election-grade data integrity and nationally deployed cyber-operations tooling.
