% 4. Synthesis across letters and USCIS standard
% =========================================================


Taken together, ten independent experts—Deputy Mayor Baiken, development director Beisenbayev, chief inspector Kudaibergenov, Big-Data executive Sidelkovskaya, CTO Kashimov, PhD/CTO Kenshimov, integrator Panchenko, presidential Administration consultant Sanatov, information-security officer Tokayev and IT/digital-transformation director Esmagambetov—converge on the same picture of \mrl{} as an \textbf{IT project manager and architect} whose original solutions operate at city and national scale:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Original platforms, architectures and algorithms.} The letters describe (i) a unified omnichannel CRM and service-management backbone (iKOMEK 2.0 and NextITSM, registered as IP); (ii) Geonomics-based registry and election pipelines that first raised accuracy from 84\% to 100\% and then inspired similar systems in other cities; (iii) life-safety telematics (\emph{Life Signal}) reducing 112 response times and harm; (iv) city-scale video analytics (\emph{Target AI}) over 600+ cameras; (v) national DLP, 100~Gb/s backbone and NGFW architectures; (vi) high-performance e-government gateways, DPDK routers and vulnerability scanners; (vii) wireless Wi-Fi geophone arrays; and (viii) Big-Data frameworks (OSCV, transport analytics) that reshape smart-city operations.
  \item \textbf{Operational outcomes with quantified impact.} The authors report: 76\% fewer top-priority municipal problems; 28{,}4\% more citizen appeals closed (426{,}542 in 2023); election-register accuracy lifted from 84\% to 100\%; 513 new address geolocations for 25{,}036 voters; 37\% more traffic-violation detections and 3{,}755 illegal-dumping incidents captured; street-lighting projects associated with a 27{,}3\% crime reduction; unlawful data transfers reduced by 17\% and unwanted personal-data deletions by 28\%; support-response times reduced from 60 to 15 minutes; backbone fault tolerance raised to 99{,}99\%; 31\% fewer failures and 18\% faster deployment of digital services; threat-detection time reduced by 35\% and precision increased to 96{,}8\%; and reduced congestion (22\%) with higher bus punctuality (27\%) and citizen satisfaction (34\%). \ExhibitRef{BaikenLetter,BeisenbaevLetter,KudaiBergenovLetter,SanatovLetter,TokayevLetter,PanchenkoLetter,EsmagambetovLetter}
  \item \textbf{Adoption, diffusion and recognition beyond one employer.} Multiple letters explain that \mrls algorithms and architectures became examples for other regions and cities, that his platforms are used daily in critical operations (city incident management, elections, national networks and security gateways) and that his methods set new sector standards for emergency-response telematics and cyber defense. Experts such as Sidelkovskaya and Esmagambetov explicitly evaluate his work at the level of national practice, with Sidelkovskaya placing him in the top 10\% of specialists in IT, digital technologies, urban management and innovation projects. \ExhibitRef{SidelkovskayaLetter,EsmagambetovLetter}
  \item \textbf{IT project management and portfolio leadership.} Deputy Mayor Baiken, Development Director Beisenbayev and others emphasize that \mrl{} does not merely propose ideas or write code: he establishes project offices, runs SCRUM processes, designs roadmaps with timelines and responsible owners, coordinates 20+ departments and dozens of quasi-state companies, and defends budgets and staffing plans. They credit him with creating the iKOMEK-based Project Management Department, managing portfolios of infrastructure and digital projects tied directly to Presidential mandates and national economic-growth plans, and consistently delivering measurable results under these constraints. \ExhibitRef{BaikenLetter,BeisenbaevLetter,EsmagambetovLetter}
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{Conclusion.} Under Criterion~5, these independent letters and metrics demonstrate that \mrls contributions are both \emph{original} and of \emph{major significance} to municipal digital governance, national cybersecurity operations, AI-enabled smart-city systems and, critically, the \textbf{end-to-end management of complex IT projects}—including roadmap definition, multi-agency stakeholder coordination, budget and risk control, and delivery of secure, reliable platforms used at citywide and national scale.
