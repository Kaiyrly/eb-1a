% =========================================================

\subsubsection{City-scale digital platforms and data engineering: iKOMEK109 CRM/automation, election voter-roll accuracy to 100\%, and registered \emph{NextITSM}}
\label{subsubsec:ContributionsIKomek}

\SubSubSubSection{Context and scope}
The Development Department of the Astana city service center iKOMEK109 confirms that \mrl played a leading role in building core digital platforms for the capital city. According to Anuar Beisenbayev, Director of the Development Department, Mr.~Taximov personally authored and coordinated several strategic projects: a new CRM/automation system with omnichannel service intake, a data-engineering pipeline that raised election voter-roll accuracy to 100\%, and the development of the NextITSM platform that was formally registered as intellectual property. \ExhibitRef{BeisenbaevLetter,BeisenbayevCV}

\SubSubSubSection{Original contribution (product and data program management)}
\paragraph{A. CRM/automation and omnichannel intake.}
Mr.~Taximov designed and delivered a new CRM platform that served as the backbone for iKOMEK109’s city services. The system was built on a modern technology stack (React, TypeScript, Next.js, Prisma, PostgreSQL) and integrated all incoming service channels — the 109 call center, a mobile application, and Telegram bots. The new system unified intake and introduced automation features, analytics dashboards, and scorecards for executive management. As Beisenbayev explains:
