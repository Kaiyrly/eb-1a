\subsubsection{President of the Republic of Kazakhstan — "Bolashak" International Scholarship (2013–2014)}
\label{subsubsec:Bolashak2013}

\SubSubSubSection{What was awarded and by whom}
JSC "Center for International Programs" (\textbf{CIP}) under the Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Kazakhstan issued two \emph{Financial Guarantee and Support Letters} confirming that \textbf{Mr.\ Askar Taximov} is a recipient of the \textbf{Bolashak International Scholarship of the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan}. One letter is addressed to \textbf{University College London (UCL)} and one to the \textbf{British Embassy Office} (for visa processing). Each letter is signed by the President of CIP and identifies the funded degree (\emph{Master}) and major (\emph{Building and Urban Design in Development}), with the funded period \textbf{23 September 2013 to 22 September 2014}. \ExhibitRef{BolashakFG_UCL}\ExhibitRef{BolashakFG_Embassy}

\SubSubSubSection{Official Status and Candidate Selection Framework}

The \emph{Bolashak International Scholarship of the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan} was established by Presidential Decree on November 5, 1993, initiated by the First President of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev. The program aims to develop highly qualified personnel in priority economic sectors by funding advanced academic studies and internships abroad.

The scholarship operates according to Government resolutions that approve the \emph{Rules for selecting candidates for the Bolashak scholarship}. By Presidential Decree No. 1569 dated May 4, 2005, the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan was mandated to approve the Rules for selection of applicants for the award of the Bolashak International Scholarship. \ExhibitRef{BolashakDecree2005} Additionally, by Government Decree No. 301 dated April 4, 2005, the Joint Stock Company "Center for International Programs" (CIP) was established with 100\% state participation in the authorized capital to administer the program. \ExhibitRef{BolashakDecree2005}

\paragraph{Three-Round Competitive Selection Process.} The Bolashak selection operates through a rigorous, merit-based competitive process consisting of three distinct rounds:

% \begin{itemize}
% \item \textbf{Round 1 — Comprehensive Testing:} All applicants undergo qualifying examinations administered by JSC "Center for International Programs." Testing includes (i) language proficiency assessments in both Kazakh (state language) and foreign language (English or other relevant language); and (ii) psychological evaluation to assess readiness for international study. Candidates who fail to meet the threshold scores established by the Ministry of Education and Science are eliminated and do not advance. \ExhibitRef{BolashakDecree2005}

% \item \textbf{Round 2 — Independent Expert Commission Interview:} Successful Round 1 candidates proceed to personal interviews conducted by an Independent Expert Commission (IEC) composed of representatives from various Ministries and government departments. The IEC evaluates: (i) professional training and theoretical knowledge; (ii) professional competencies in the chosen field; (iii) knowledge of Kazakhstan's Constitution, history, and national symbols; (iv) candidate motivation and preparedness for studying abroad; and (v) understanding of the chosen study program and university. The IEC provides personalized recommendations for each candidate. The composition and procedures of this commission are approved by the Ministry of Education and Science. \ExhibitRef{BolashakDecree2005}

% \item \textbf{Round 3 — Republican Commission Final Decision:} The \textbf{Republican Commission for Training Personnel Abroad} makes final decisions on scholarship awards. This Commission is chaired by the State Counselor of the Republic of Kazakhstan and comprises 27 members including Ministers, Agency Chairmen, Parliament representatives, and Presidential Administration heads—all appointed by the President of Kazakhstan. The Commission reviews all examination results, IEC recommendations, and national priorities. Decisions require a quorum of two-thirds of members present and are made by open vote requiring at least three-quarters majority. Results are published on the official website (www.bolashak.gov.kz) within three business days. \ExhibitRef{BolashakDecree2005}
% \end{itemize}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item \textbf{Round 1 — Comprehensive Testing:} All stages are conducted online, and Round 1 consists of proctored verbal and numerical reasoning tests together with a standardized personality questionnaire assessing psychological readiness and core competencies for study abroad; candidates must meet the minimum thresholds set by the governing body to advance, repeated testing is not allowed, a standard calculator (but not smartphone calculators) may be used, and closing the browser or test tabs voids results under audio/video‑monitored administration. \ExhibitRef{BolashakSelection2025} [web:13][web:49]

% \item \textbf{Round 2 — Expert Commission Interview:} The administrator conducts an anonymous personal interview with the Expert Commission, during which questions may be in the state language, Russian, or the intended language of study, and evaluation focuses on research preparation in the chosen field, theoretical knowledge, motivation and rationale for the specialization and host institution, and logical reasoning. \ExhibitRef{BolashakSelection2025} [web:13][web:49]

% \item \textbf{Round 3 — Republican Commission Decision:} The Executive Body submits the testing results, Expert Commission recommendations, and the approved ranking table to the Republican Commission for Training Personnel Abroad, which reviews Rounds 1–2 and issues the final award or denial with notice made by publishing the decision on the administrator’s official website after the meeting protocol is signed. \ExhibitRef{BolashakSelection2025} [web:49][web:11]
% \end{itemize}

\textbf{Round 1 — Comprehensive Testing}

Candidates complete three online assessments, administered with audio and video monitoring:

\textbf{Verbal Reasoning Test}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Evaluates the ability to analyze and process complex written information efficiently
    \item Tests comprehension, logical reasoning, and decision-making skills
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Numerical Reasoning Test}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Assesses capacity to work with quantitative data under time constraints
    \item Measures analytical ability to interpret and draw conclusions from numerical information
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Personality Assessment}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Gathers structured information about professional qualities and interpersonal competencies
    \item Evaluates psychological readiness for study abroad, including communication skills, emotional resilience, and adaptability in new environments
\end{itemize}

Candidates must meet the minimum threshold score established by the governing body to advance. No retesting is permitted. A candidate who fails to achieve the required score does not proceed to Round 2.

\textbf{Round 2 — Expert Commission Interview}

An anonymous personal interview conducted by the Expert Commission assesses each candidate's professional preparation and suitability for the scholarship. The interview focuses on:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Research preparation and theoretical knowledge in the candidate's chosen field
    \item Motivation for the selected specialization and host institution
    \item Understanding of the academic program and host country
    \item Logical reasoning and critical thinking ability
\end{itemize}

Questions may be conducted in the state language, Russian, or the language of study.

\textbf{Round 3 — Republican Commission Decision}

The Republican Commission for Training Personnel Abroad reviews the test results from Round~1 and recommendations from the Expert Commission. The Commission issues a final decision awarding or denying the scholarship, which is published on the administrator's official website following the meeting.

\noindent\textit{(Official status of the Republican Commission.)}  
The \textbf{Republican Commission for Training Personnel Abroad} serves as an \emph{advisory and consultative body} to the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan, established under \textbf{Presidential Decree No.~470 of October~12,~2000}.\ExhibitRef{BolashakDecree2000} The Commission is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the \emph{Bolashak International Scholarship} and related scientific internship programs, and its members are appointed directly by the President. It is chaired by the \textbf{State Counselor of the Republic of Kazakhstan}, with the \textbf{Minister of Science and Higher Education} serving as Deputy Chairperson and the \textbf{Vice-Minister} as Secretary.  

As revised by \textbf{Presidential Decree No.~591 of June~29,~2024}, the Commission’s composition includes the heads of key national ministries and agencies—such as Foreign Affairs, Justice, Finance, Labor, Digital Development, and Ecology—along with representatives from both chambers of Parliament and the Presidential Administration. The \textbf{Ministry of Science and Higher Education} functions as the working body, preparing materials for meetings, maintaining official records, and coordinating the placement and employment of Bolashak scholars.  

Commission sessions are considered valid with a quorum of two-thirds of members, and resolutions are adopted by open vote requiring at least a three-quarters majority. This procedural framework ensures that every Bolashak scholarship is awarded through a transparent, merit-based, and state-supervised process aligned with national priorities for developing Kazakhstan’s human capital.\ExhibitRef{BolashakDecree2000}


\noindent This framework ensures highly selective outcomes: with annual applicant numbers reaching approximately 10,000 and only around 500 scholarships granted (including Mr.\ Taximov's cohort of 427 recipients in 2013), the acceptance rate typically remained near 5\%, underscoring the program's exclusivity and competitive standards.

Key provisions of the selection Rules include:

\begin{itemize}
\item The competitive selection is conducted on a nationwide scale with \textbf{public announcements made in mass media}. The application intake and preliminary screening are managed by JSC "Center for International Programs" (CIP). \ExhibitRef{BolashakDecree2005}

\item Candidates must satisfy rigorous academic and language proficiency requirements. Language-of-instruction competency—typically in English—is validated through recognized certifications. \ExhibitRef{BolashakDecreeAmend}

\item A \textbf{field-alignment criterion} mandates that applicants' previous higher education specialties be relevant to their intended area of study abroad. This ensures alignment between Kazakhstan's workforce needs and training specialties. \ExhibitRef{BolashakDecreeAmend}
\end{itemize}

\SubSubSubSection{What the letters guarantee (award benefits)}
Both CIP letters state that the Government of Kazakhstan, via CIP, \emph{"serves as sponsor and guarantor"} and \emph{covers the following expenditures} for the scholarship period:
\begin{itemize}
  \item application forms for placement; visa and registration fees (once per year);
  \item \textbf{round-trip travel} (Kazakhstan \(\leftrightarrow\) country of study) once every academic year;
  \item \textbf{full tuition and mandatory university fees} per the university's approved plan;
  \item \textbf{living costs: food USD~1{,}000/month and accommodation USD~1{,}200/month} (per Program standards);
  \item \textbf{book allowance USD~400 per annum};
  \item medical examination (where mandatory) and \textbf{health insurance} for the academic year.
\end{itemize}
The letters expressly certify that Mr.\ Taximov \emph{"will be fully funded by the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan for the approved duration of his academic program at the University College London."} \ExhibitRef{BolashakFG_UCL}\ExhibitRef{BolashakFG_Embassy}



\SubSubSubSection{Documented value of the award (one academic year)}
The funded period spans \textbf{12 months} (23 Sep 2013–22 Sep 2014). Using only fixed amounts stated in the letters:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Food: \(\$1{,}000 \times 12 = \mathbf{\$12{,}000}\)
  \item Accommodation: \(\$1{,}200 \times 12 = \mathbf{\$14{,}400}\)
  \item Books: \(\mathbf{\$400}\) (per annum)
  \item Tuition (UCL): \(\text{GBP }14{,}000 \times \text{USD}\,\approx1.60/\text{GBP} \approx \mathbf{\$22{,}400}\) \emph{(representative 2013–2014 rate)} 
\end{itemize}
\noindent\textbf{Subtotal (fixed living, books \& tuition): \(\$26{,}800 + \$22{,}400 = \mathbf{\$49{,}200}\).} As documented in the record, the \textbf{total scholarship funding allocated for the UCL academic year} was \textbf{approximately \$100{,}000}; \textbf{the other half of the overall award} was used for \textbf{1.5 years of preparatory courses} prior to enrollment (language, pre-sesssional course and pre-master training). \ExhibitRef{BolashakFG_UCL}\ExhibitRef{BolashakFG_Embassy}

\SubSubSubSection{Field alignment \& Master of Science dissertation (Spatial Decision Support System)}
Mr.\ Taximov's long-term professional intention was to pivot fully into \textbf{IT and data-driven product work}. Under Bolashak's legal framework, however, the funded specialty abroad had to be \emph{related to the prior undergraduate degree}. \ExhibitRef{BolashakDecreeAmend} Accordingly, he undertook UCL's \emph{Building and Urban Design in Development}—a closely allied program that \textbf{actively employs information technologies}. To operationalize this bridge, his MsC dissertation developed a \textbf{Spatial Decision Support System (SDSS)} for housing-need assessment in Kazakhstan, with a working prototype documented in the thesis. \ExhibitRef{UCLSDSSDissertation}

\noindent\textit{Core components implemented (per dissertation):}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Data ingestion layer:} a custom Java web crawler collected rental listings from KRISHA.kz; demographic statistics were sourced from the national portal (stat.gov.kz) and stored together with listings in \textbf{MongoDB}. \ExhibitRef{UCLSDSSDissertation}
  \item \textbf{GIS \& basemaps:} spatial boundaries (polygons) were prepared from \textbf{GADM} and rendered via the \textbf{Google Maps API}, producing interactive thematic layers. \ExhibitRef{UCLSDSSDissertation}
  \item \textbf{Computation model:} a transparent, normalized \emph{need indicator} computed as \(\text{rental flats available} \,/\, \text{population}\) by area (parameterized by dwelling type and capture frequency)—that is a single normalized metric rather than a multi-criteria model. \ExhibitRef{UCLSDSSDissertation}
  \item \textbf{Integration, UI \& presentation:}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Backend integration.} A Java/Spring application orchestrated the crawl–store–compute pipeline and exposed REST parameters (e.g., dwelling type and administrative level) for queryable outputs. \ExhibitRef{UCLSDSSDissertation}
    \item \emph{Map UI \& outputs.} The Google Maps JavaScript API rendered polygon overlays from KML; users filtered by 1/2/3-room dwellings and the system produced citywide decision-support maps. \ExhibitRef{UCLSDSSDissertation}
  \end{itemize}
  % --- Optional line below: include only if you attach supporting files showing tool usage ---
  \item \textbf{Ancillary drafting \& layout:} final diagram and page-layout touch-ups were prepared in standard CAD/graphics software (\textbf{AutoCAD}, \textbf{CorelDRAW}). % \ExhibitRef{UCLSDSS_CAD_Workfiles}
\end{itemize}


\noindent This SDSS work embedded substantive \textbf{software, data and platform engineering} (crawler, database, APIs, backend integration, GIS rendering) in a planning-oriented degree and directly informed Mr.\ Taximov's subsequent \textbf{IT product and program leadership} (e.g., GIS-backed dashboards, spatial analytics and data pipelines in civic platforms), ultimately serving as the bridge into full-time \textbf{IT Project Management}.


\SubSubSubSection{Why this qualifies under USCIS Criterion 1 (lesser nationally or internationally recognized awards)}
Bolashak is a \textbf{national, presidential scholarship} awarded through \textbf{competitive, expert-reviewed selection} with final decisions by a \textbf{Republican Commission} chaired by the State Counselor and comprising 27 senior government officials appointed by the President. \ExhibitRef{BolashakDecree2005}\ExhibitRef{BolashakDecreeAmend} The three-round selection process—comprehensive testing, Independent Expert Commission interviews, and Republican Commission final decision—demonstrates the rigorous merit-based evaluation that distinguishes Bolashak recipients from the general population of applicants (5\% acceptance rate in 2013). The CIP letters prove \textbf{individual receipt} by Mr.\ Taximov and \textbf{substantial value} (total \(\$200{,}000\)). Although the funded master's specialization was adjacent to—rather than identical with—pure IT, the program's \textbf{SDSS dissertation} anchored his studies in \textbf{information technologies and data systems}, directly supporting his subsequent career in \textbf{IT Project Management}. Taken together, this is a \textbf{lesser nationally recognized award for excellence} that meets Criterion~1.

% PRESIDENT — SCO SUMMIT (2024)
% =========================================================
\subsubsection{President of the Republic of Kazakhstan — Letter of Appreciation for the SCO Summit (2024)}
\label{subsubsec:PresSCO2024}

\SubSubSubSection{What was awarded and by whom}
In 2024, Mr.~Taximov received a formal \emph{Presidential Letter of Appreciation} signed by \textbf{Kassym\kern0.08em-Jomart Tokayev}, \textbf{President of the Republic of Kazakhstan}, for a significant contribution to the organization and conduct of the \emph{Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) Summit} in Astana. The document bears state insignia and personally names Mr.~Taximov. \ExhibitRef{PresAlghys2024}

\ParagraphQuoteByExhibit{``I express my gratitude for your active participation in preparing and holding the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in Astana at a high level.''}{President of Kazakhstan, Letter of Appreciation (2024) — Eng.\ transl.}{PresAlghys2024}

\SubSubSubSection{Operational context and scope of contribution}
Under Mr.~Taximov’s leadership, the \emph{iKOMEK109} Monitoring and Rapid Response Center executed an integrated operational program for the summit that combined organizational measures with citywide IT infrastructure:

\paragraph{Organizational measures.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{24/7 citizen-intake operations} across public safety, housing and utilities and other urban-infrastructure topics;
  \item \textbf{Digital monitoring of public channels:} social-media operators tracked mentions and resident signals and escalated incidents in near real time;
  \item \textbf{On-site multi-agency operations hub} hosted at iKOMEK109 to coordinate emergency and security services and ensure timely response to potential threats and incidents.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Use of IT infrastructurem hardware and software complexes.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{City video-surveillance complex} (IP cameras, videowalls, processing servers) monitored mass-gathering sites, infrastructure facilities, rail/bus terminals, the airport and key roads and intersections;
  \item \textbf{Situational video analytics} supported heat maps, crowding detection and tracking of pedestrian and vehicle flows;
  \item \textbf{Cyber-protection measures} included protected data channels (VPN and encryption), server and system redundancy and network-activity monitoring to prevent unauthorized access;
  \item \textbf{Systems integration with public-safety agencies} (police, emergency and medical) enabled automatic routing of alerts and instant interagency interaction.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Result recognized by the award.}
The merger of these organizational workflows with surveillance analytics, cyber-defense and real-time digital communications ensured a high level of safety for summit guests and participants, stable functioning of city infrastructure and rapid response to threats in both physical and digital domains. The Presidential Commendation recognizes Mr.~Taximov’s key role and leadership in applying IT tools to address operations of national significance. % Source: explanatory note + Presidential letter (attached)

\SubSubSubSection{Why this is in the field (product and program leadership)}
The initiative required end-to-end ownership of mission-critical civic platforms: defining processes orchestrating cross-agency teams, integrating hardware–software systems, instrumenting analytics, enforcing reliability and security controls and operating at international-event scale—core responsibilities of product and program leadership in the IT Project Management domain.

\SubSubSubSection{Why this is a \emph{lesser nationally recognized} award}
A named, signed \emph{Presidential} commendation tied to an international summit constitutes national-level recognition for excellence in the field and satisfies USCIS Criterion~1 for lesser nationally recognized awards.

\textbf{Legal status of the Presidential Letter of Appreciation.}

Under the official Regulation on the Presidential Letter of Appreciation of the Republic of Kazakhstan (Presidential Order No. 164 of January 12, 2021, updating Order No. 3230 of November 20, 1996), the “Letter of Appreciation of the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan” is defined as an official form of state recognition awarded by the Head of State for exceptional service and achievements benefiting society and the nation. The Regulation specifies that each Letter is personally signed by the President, bears national insignia, is formally registered by the Presidential Administration, and entered into the official Registry of Presidential Commendations. This codified procedure confirms that the Letter represents a formal governmental award rather than a ceremonial expression of gratitude. Accordingly, both personally addressed and signed Presidential Letter of Appreciation constitutes a nationally recognized distinction evidencing excellence and fulfills the evidentiary standard for a “lesser nationally recognized prize or award for excellence in the field of endeavor” under 8 C.F.R. § 204.5(h)(3)(i).

\subsubsection{President of the Republic of Kazakhstan — Letter of Appreciation for the Extraordinary Presidential Election (2022)}
\label{subsubsec:PresElection2022}

\SubSubSubSection{What was awarded and by whom}
In November 2022, Mr.~Taximov received a formal \emph{Presidential Letter of Appreciation} signed by \textbf{Kassym\kern0.08em-Jomart Tokayev}, President of the Republic of Kazakhstan, for his significant contribution to the preparation and conduct of the country’s extraordinary presidential election. \ExhibitRef{PresAlghys2022}

\ParagraphQuoteByExhibit{``I thank you for your significant contribution to the preparation and conduct of the Presidential election of the Republic of Kazakhstan.''}{President of Kazakhstan, Letter of Appreciation (2022) — Eng.\ transl.}{PresAlghys2022}

\SubSubSubSection{Election technology and data-governance program (delivered under Mr.~Taximov’s direction)}
To ensure accuracy, transparency and security of the electoral process in the capital, Mr.~Taximov led an integrated program that combined organizational measures with a citywide technical implementation based on the \emph{Geonomics — Population Database} platform:

\paragraph{Organizational measures.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Voter-roll accuracy and automated precinct:} updating voter lists and registration address codes(RAC), to ensure automatic polling station assignment;
  \item \textbf{Identification of overcrowded registration addresses:} joint work with district mayors’ offices and the migration service to identify and correct anomalous multi-registrations;
  \item \textbf{Generation of final voter list:} coordination with territorial commissions to form and approve final voter lists;
  \item \textbf{Unified election call center at iKOMEK109:} operator training, a structured knowledge base and scripted escalation flows for citizen inquiries;
  \item \textbf{Digital voter services:} launch of online tools and a Telegram bot for voters to check their polling station;
  \item \textbf{Monitoring and analytics of citizen requests} throughout the election period.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Technical measures.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Core platform:} use and adaptation of the \emph{Geonomics — Population Database} information system;
  \item \textbf{Data integrations:} linkage with the state \emph{Individuals} database and other sources to update records; automated attachment of voters to precincts by registered address to eliminate manual errors;
  \item \textbf{GIS visualization:} digital precinct mapping, display of citizen distribution, territory analysis and precinct/district boundary construction;
  \item \textbf{Correction of address geolocations:} ingestion and processing of vector, raster and attribute datasets with real-time editing and analysis;
  \item \textbf{Security and access:} authenticated access (including e-signature login), protected export to approved formats (MDB, XLS) and service integrations via REST/SOAP/WSDL;
  \item \textbf{Implementation stack:} development using \textbf{Python, JavaScript, SQL and Java} to achieve performance, scalability and reliability under high data volumes.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Result (recognized by the Presidential letter).}
The program delivered highly accurate and up-to-date voter lists, transparent and convenient citizen services (online tools and a unified call center) and a resilient, secure information infrastructure for the national election. \ExhibitRef{PresAlghys2022}

\SubSubSubSection{Why this is in the field (product and program leadership)}
This initiative combined discovery (legal and stakeholder requirements), delivery (data pipelines, GIS services, voter tools, contact-center workflows) and operations (security controls, SLAs, quality gates)—the end-to-end lifecycle of public-sector product and program leadership at national scale.

\SubSubSubSection{Why this is a \emph{lesser nationally recognized} award}
A \emph{Presidential} letter of appreciation tied to the conduct of a countrywide election is a nationally recognized distinction documenting excellence in a matter of national importance.

\textbf{Legal status of the Presidential Letter of Appreciation.}

Under the official Regulation on the Presidential Letter of Appreciation of the Republic of Kazakhstan (Presidential Order No. 164 of January 12, 2021, updating Order No. 3230 of November 20, 1996), the “Letter of Appreciation of the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan” is defined as an official form of state recognition awarded by the Head of State for exceptional service and achievements benefiting society and the nation. The Regulation specifies that each Letter is personally signed by the President, bears national insignia, is formally registered by the Presidential Administration, and entered into the official Registry of Presidential Commendations. This codified procedure confirms that the Letter represents a formal governmental award rather than a ceremonial expression of gratitude. Accordingly, both personally addressed and signed Presidential Letter of Appreciation constitutes a nationally recognized distinction evidencing excellence and fulfills the evidentiary standard for a “lesser nationally recognized prize or award for excellence in the field of endeavor” under 8 C.F.R. § 204.5(h)(3)(i).

\textbf{Legal status of the Presidential Letter of Appreciation.}


Under the Regulation on the Presidential Letter of Appreciation of the Republic of Kazakhstan (Presidential Order No.~164 of January 12, 2021, amending Order No.~3230 of November 20, 1996), the “Letter of Appreciation of the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan” is established as an official form of moral and state recognition awarded by the Head of State for merits before society and the nation (Clause 2). The Regulation defines a formal procedure for preparation, registration, announcement, and presentation of the Letter (Clause 1). Each Letter is personally signed by the President and bears state insignia (Clause 4 (2)); decisions to confer it are made by the President either on his own initiative or upon the recommendation of governmental bodies and organizations (Clause 5).  

The Presidential Administration carries out official registration, documentation, and delivery of each Letter (Clause 9), while the record of all conferred Letters is maintained in an electronic registration database and the Book of Presidential Letters of Appreciation (Clause 10). The Regulation further provides that information on each award is entered into the recipient’s employment record and personal file (Clause 11).  

This codified, state-supervised procedure confirms that the Presidential Letter of Appreciation is not a ceremonial expression of gratitude but a formal governmental distinction issued under presidential authority, bearing evidentiary equivalence to a national-level award. Accordingly, every personally addressed and signed Presidential Letter of Appreciation constitutes a nationally recognized prize or award for excellence in the field of endeavor within the meaning of 8 C.F.R. § 204.5(h)(3)(i).
