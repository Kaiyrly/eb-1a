\label{subsec:Judging}

\subsubsection{Astana International University (AIU) Permanent independent peer reviewer of the university journal}

\label{subsubsec:JudgingAIU}

The President of Astana International University confirms on institutional letterhead that \mrl{} \emph{is a permanent independent reviewer of the scientific journal of our university \textbf{International Science Reviews. Natural Sciences and Technologies series}''.} The letter specifies that, considering \mrls expertise in IT and innovation, he \emph{considers and evaluates scientific works and articles in innovative and information technology directions''} including topics such as \emph{``use of Big Data in managing national companies, introduction of information technologies in startup projects, creation of technologies for data analysis in social projects use of artificial intelligence in engineering systems and the use of Data Science when forming information security''} (English translation of the official letter). \ExhibitRef{AIUReviewer}

The same AIU letter describes the substantive peer review functions performed by \mrl{} He \emph{assesses the relevance of the topic studied, the authenticity of the presented facts, the argumentation and clarity of the author's exposition and conclusions''} and, crucially, \emph{formulates a decision on the admission of the article, the possibility or impossibility of publication in the above mentioned journal or the need for further revision''} (English translation). \ExhibitRef{AIUReviewer}

These statements prove \textbf{actual participation} with publish revise decline outcomes, as required by USCIS.

AIUs journal portal identifies the reviewed venue as \emph{International Science Reviews. Natural Sciences and Technologies Series} with \emph{ISSN 2707 4862 and Owned `Astana International University' LLP (Astana, Kazakhstan)''} Its thematic focus is explicitly \emph{devoted to research in the field of natural sciences \dots as well as technologies such as information technology, information security, engineering, metallurgy and oil and gas production and processing''} and the periodicity is \emph{``4 times a year''} \ExhibitRef{AIUScienceSite}

Due to the fact that the journals scope \textbf{expressly includes information technology and information security} the works judged are in the same or allied field to \fie.

AIUs own overview states the universitys mission is \emph{to provide a high level of knowledge and competence \dots through academic excellence, research and innovation to serve the nation and the world''} and its vision is to be \emph{a modern global university generating and disseminating knowledge, research and innovation for the Eurasian space''} Among listed priorities are \emph{conducting fundamental and applied research''} and training in \emph{information and communication technologies''} \ExhibitRef{AIUSite}

This confirms that \mrl{} was entrusted with peer review in a \textbf{scholarly, research driven venue}.

In addition to the internal appointment and the journal portal, AIU maintains active public profiles

and institutional pages that corroborate its identity and academic activity

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{AIU official Instagram} The verified profile reflects institutional outreach,

admissions and research messaging and public contact information, confirming AIUs status as an

operating higher education institution in Astana \ExhibitRef{AIUInstagram}

\item \textbf{AIU About page} The universitys own overview states a mission to

\emph{`provide a high level of knowledge and competence \dots through academic excellence,

research and innovation''} and a vision to operate as a \emph{`modern global university

generating and disseminating knowledge''} This aligns with the journals scholarly positioning

and the entrustment of formal peer review \ExhibitRef{AIUSite}

\item \textbf{AIU journal portal} The \emph{International Science Reviews. Natural Sciences and

Technologies Series} page lists \emph{ISSN 2707 4862} owner \emph{`Astana International

University'' LLP} scope explicitly covering \emph{information technology} and \emph{information

security} and periodicity \emph{`4 times a year''} This confirms the venues identity

field alignment and regular publication cadence \ExhibitRef{AIUScienceSite}

\end{itemize}

Taken together, these \emph{public, verifiable} sources demonstrate that the judging occurred in a

recognized university backed scholarly venue with an IT cybersecurity scope consistent with USCIS

expectations for a professional forum \ExhibitRef{AIUInstagram,AIUSite,AIUScienceSite}

The Department of Science and Commercialization of L.N.\ Gumilyov Eurasian National University confirms that \mrl{} \emph{is indeed a reviewer of the scientific journal `Vestnik of L.N.\ Gumilyov Eurasian National University' and on a permanent basis participates in the evaluation of scientific articles''} on topics including \emph{the introduction of information and innovative technologies in companies, trends in IT technologies and their effective influence on regional development, Data Science as an instrument to increase business profitabilit, SQL and Data analytics''} (English translation of the official letter) \ExhibitRef{ENUReviewer}

ENU specifies that \mrl{} reviews submissions for \emph{scientific novelty, the relevance of the problem, scientific and practical significance of the research, depth of elaboration of the topic, style of presentation and innovative approach to the scientific work''} and, based on that assessment, \emph{makes a conclusion on the advisability of publishing the article or the need for rejection revision''} (English translation) \ExhibitRef{ENUReviewer}

This demonstrates that \mrl{} \textbf{actually judged} manuscripts and issued accept revise reject decisions.

ENUs official \emph{Science} pages describe a large research ecosystem with \emph{research divisions closely co operate with faculties, university departments \dots schools of thought \dots [and] more than 160 scientific projects \dots under fundamental and applied programs of research''} including \emph{mathematical modeling and innovative technologies''} and \emph{`physicists and high technologies''} \ExhibitRef{ENUScienceSite}

The university overview further notes ENUs status and international recognition including memberships and accreditations describing ENU as \emph{`a university with special status \dots an implementer of academic innovative technologies and continuer of the best research traditions''} \ExhibitRef{ENUSite}

Given the topics ENU assigned to \mrl{} (Data Science, SQL and analytics, IT trends and innovation) the peer review work is plainly in the \textbf{same or allied field} to \fie.

To further establish ENU as a recognized professional venue for scholarly review

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{ENU official Instagram} The verified institutional profile evidences active public

communications for a large national university (nameplate, follower base, contact information)

corroborating ENUs identity and visibility \ExhibitRef{ENUInstagram}

\item \textbf{ENU official site (Science University pages)} ENU details its research ecosystem

(research centers, laboratories, fundamental and applied projects, participation in national

programs) international memberships and accreditation background These pages support ENUs

standing as a research intensive university where peer review is a professional scholarly function

\ExhibitRef{ENUSite,ENUScienceSite}

\item \textbf{QS TopUniversities rankings} Third party QS pages place ENU in the QS World

University Rankings (global) and show high regional standing in Central Asia These independent

rankings further validate ENUs reputation and the professional character of its journals and

editorial processes \ExhibitRef{ENUQSRanking}

\end{itemize}

The combination of official university pages, verified public profiles and third party rankings

confirms ENUs stature as a recognized scholarly venue In light of the assigned IT Data Science

manuscripts and the editorial discretion described by ENU this constitutes judging in the same or

allied field \ExhibitRef{ENUInstagram,ENUSite,ENUScienceSite,ENUQSRanking}
