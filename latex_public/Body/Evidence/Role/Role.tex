\subsubsection{Municipal State Enterprise “iKOMEK109” City Monitoring and Rapid Response Center}

\label{subsubsec:RoleIKomek}

iKOMEK109 serves as the capital's single service hub. It runs a contact line open day and night, a situation room that pulls together camera plus sensor data to keep the city watched at every moment and an analytics team that sifts large data sets to spot recurring problems for city leaders. The Deputy Mayor’s letter describes the organization’s scope explicitly: \emph{“iKOMEK represents the city’s unified Situation Center comprised of: (1) the iKOMEK109 contact center [more than 2.2 million citizen requests per year], (2) the monitoring Situation Center with integrated camera networks, fire-prevention systems and IoT solutions and (3) the Analytics Center that works with Big Data to identify issues and escalate to the city’s leadership.”} \ExhibitRef{IKomekDeputyAkimLetter}

The national government portal gov kz confirms the center merged municipal hotlines. It acts as a single 24 hour contact point. The portal lists all intake channels and a catalog of 2{,}500 plus services. Staff resolve 85\% of issues on the first call \ExhibitRef{IKomekGov}. City Transportation Systems (CTS) directs all public transport questions to iKOMEK109. This confirms the center is central to citizen services. The verified iKOMEK109 Instagram profile shows public outreach and scale. It proves the Center is the city’s unified 109 operator.

The Deputy Mayor of Astana confirms that Mr. Taximov has served as Head of iKOMEK109 since May 27 2022, a role combining executive leadership regarding policy and budgeting with hands on product and engineering direction. Under Mr. Taximov’s leadership, iKOMEK109 implemented weekly executive reporting to the Mayor focused on the most acute citywide issues: \textit{“The weekly practice at the Mayor’s executive meeting on prioritizing the most resonant citizen problems reduced unresolved items from 112 to 27 (−76\%).”}

The team focused on old backlog items. They closed 426{,}542 cases in 2023. This count rose +28.4\% over 2022. Managers redesigned workflows and set strict deadlines. They created clear procedures for problem escalation. iKOMEK governance guided citywide repairs. Crews modernized 80+ playgrounds. They reconstructed 43 sports grounds. Workers installed 378 km of street lighting in problem areas. The letter links these improvements to better safety. Crime dropped by 27.3\%. New detection algorithms spot criminal behaviors better. This includes crimes like drug stashing:

\begin{itemize}[nosep]
 \item +17\% increase in registered cases related to drug stashing versus the prior year
 \item 23 criminal cases and 19{,}384 administrative offenses supported of which 13{,}015 were protocolled

The new plan includes an annual bonus linked to performance. He signed an MOU with Otbasy Bank to help workers save for housing. Staff loyalty scores reached 42 \ExhibitRef{IKomekDeputyAkimLetter}. A minister visited in March 2024. Mr. Taximov then started a direct complaints channel to medical institutions. The system sends over 150 calls a week to four pilot facilities. He updated the youth practice program. It trained more than 60 people. The staff now includes ten people with disabilities. This effort won recognition for inclusive hiring.

He broke down plus templated 32 projects that covered Presidential directives, including reduction of utility wear, commissioning of heating plants, acceleration of light rail transit, and major road reconstructions. Mr. Taximov created a Department of IT besides Development that focuses on Data Science and uses Python and SQL to keep analytical work running. The team delivered election period data engineering that raised register accuracy from 84\% to 100\% by geolocating 25{,}036 voters and correcting 1{,}000+ addresses using algorithms and mapping tools. Concurrently, Mr. Taximov staffed an in house product team to execute the iKOMEK~2.0 roadmap, covering a new CRM, external integrations, analytics tools, database optimization, and improved online channels. The iKOMEK 2.0 presentation and companion script visualize this operating model, while snapshots of the official site and independent press coverage provide objective corroboration of the leadership role and organizational scale. \ExhibitRef{IKomekPresentation}\ExhibitRef{IKomekPresentationScript}\ExhibitRef{IKomekSiteShot}\ExhibitRef{IKomekPress}

The organization prong is satisfied by the official citywide mandate and scale of iKOMEK109. The performance prong is met by documented leadership and critical outcomes such as crime reduction, systemic hazard remediation, backlog liquidation, and digital channel adoption. These enterprise level results are tied directly to Mr. Taximov’s role.

\subsubsection{Joint Stock Company “State Technical Service” STS National Cybersecurity Operator}

\label{subsubsec:RoleSTS}

STS is the \textit{national cybersecurity operator}. It protects electronic government systems and critical information infrastructure. 

The organization runs KZ CERT and maintains national coordination centers. It also performs security testing and monitoring. Public materials show national services and training. These efforts show a mission suited to a distinguished organization. 

An official letter on STS letterhead confirms the mandate. It verifies the daily use of the platforms described below. Official site snapshots and a verified Instagram channel prove the public standing of STS.

Mr. Taximov became an Independent Director and Board member on January 18, 2022. He chairs the Strategic Development Committee. He directs information and cybersecurity programs. The role combines governance with practical leadership. The role letter further notes his participation as a chief expert analyst in commissions evaluating the security of government systems which places him in a permanent technical gatekeeping function. This dual positioning covering governance plus technical gatekeeping is probative of a leading and critical role at an organization with a national mandate. \ExhibitRef{STSRoleLetter}

The STS system uses a Telegram bot for internal teams. It manages keywords and runs searches every four hours. The tool uses Google Programmable Search. It logs data and alerts users. These tools give early warnings about open-source issues. Operators then organize the alerts into formal responses. The letter confirms: \textit{“The Telegram bot was implemented for STS divisions and is used in everyday work.”} \ExhibitRef{STSRoleLetter}


Synaq automates security testing for government software. It includes a web app, a data store, and an admin module. The system manages requests for quotations and test requests digitally, and it issues electronic protocols with digital signatures. Synaq replaces paper processes with digital protocols. This change strengthens evidence chains and cuts administrative time. The contribution memo confirms these functions. It states: \textit{“Development of Synaq automated the testing process, significantly reduced paperwork and is used in STS operations.”} \ExhibitRef{STSRoleLetter}\ExhibitRef{STSContribution}


ScanKZ continuously collects data on device exposure across the IP ranges and domains of Kazakhstan to feed KZ CERT prevention work. Data collected include subdomains, IP addresses, open ports, and device versions. This capability serves as a \emph{national attack surface inventory} that increases coverage and timeliness of vulnerability notifications. The role letter notes it \textit{“\ldots improves KZ-CERT prevention by automatically identifying vulnerable objects; expands the capacity to assess security of devices in Kazakhstan connected to the Internet.”} \ExhibitRef{STSRoleLetter}

These three systems work as a unit to support the national mission. The \emph{monitoring bot} finds new risks in public data, \emph{Synaq} organizes formal testing with signed digital records, and \emph{ScanKZ} finds open connections on the national network. Each platform embeds \emph{control points} foundational for a national operator, such as persistent logging and role administration. Mr. Taximov’s work covering governance, process digitization, and exposure intelligence proves his critical role in preventing threats. The status of STS as a national cyber operator satisfies the organization prong, while the performance evidence shows leadership and critical delivery of tools that are in continued operational use. \ExhibitRef{STSRoleLetter}\ExhibitRef{STSContribution}
