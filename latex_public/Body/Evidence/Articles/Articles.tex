\subsection{Evidence of \mrls authorship of scholarly articles in the field, in professional or major trade publications or other major media}
\label{subsec:Articles}

\smallskip
\noindent\textbf{Summary.} Mr.~Taximov has authored \textbf{more than ten} scholarly and professional articles in smart-city analytics, municipal data engineering, open-data/APIs and civic IT productization. Six representative publications (annotated below) demonstrate both (i) scholarly form (structured abstracts, keywords, UDC/JEL classifications, references and visible editorial processing) and (ii) professional venues (ISSN, issue/volume numbering, editorial boards, indexing/attestation status). 

% =========================================================
% Attestation framework (VAK) and why it matters to USCIS
% =========================================================
\subsubsection{Attestation framework: the Russian Higher Attestation Commission (VAK)}

\paragraph{What VAK is and does (official mandate).}
The \emph{Higher Attestation Commission (VAK) under the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation} is established “\textit{for the purpose of ensuring state scientific attestation}”. % and “\textit{is guided by the Constitution of the Russian Federation, federal constitutional laws, federal laws, decrees and orders of the President of the Russian Federation, resolutions and orders of the Government of the Russian Federation, as well as orders of the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation.}” \ExhibitRef{VAK_Polozhenie}

Among its core functions, VAK (a) “\textit{develops recommendations… on the \textbf{requirements for peer-reviewed scientific journals} and the \textbf{rules for forming the list} of peer-reviewed scientific journals}” and (b) “\textit{determines the international databases indexing scientific publications in which the main scientific results of a dissertation may be published.}” The VAK's journals are included in the list of periodical science and technical publication in Russia recommended by High Attestation Commission for publishing in order to attain Candidate of Science or Doctor of Science degree. \ExhibitRef{VAK_Polozhenie} 
%These provisions explain \emph{why} USCIS often treats VAK-listed journals as professional venues serving learned readers.

\paragraph{Why VAK status is probative here.}
Each venue below is represented in the VAK list (as reflected on the journals’ official sites/screenshots attached as exhibits), satisfying USCIS’s expectation that scholarly works appear in professional outlets with editorial governance and indexing/attestation. See venue-specific quotations and exhibits below.

% Why these works are "scholarly" and in professional venues
% =========================================================
\subsubsection{Why the record satisfies USCIS Criterion 6}

\paragraph{Scholarly nature.}
Across the exemplars, the record shows recognized scholarly apparatus: \textbf{UDC} classification (e.g., UDC~004.65), \textbf{DOI} identifiers, structured \emph{abstracts} and \emph{keywords}, learned sectioning (e.g., “Mathematical Modeling and Numerical Methods”) and substantive \emph{references}. Several items show \emph{editorial processing} markers (issue/volume, acceptance/issue pages). \ExhibitRef{Article_Vestnik_2025_Methodology}\ExhibitRef{Article_CSTP_2024_IKomek}\ExhibitRef{Article_InnovationsInvestments_2023_OpenData}

\paragraph{Professional venues with VAK/attestation signals.}
Each venue demonstrates professional indicia and VAK/list status on its official site:

\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Impact metrics (where publicly posted).}
Where publicly listed, the RSCI (eLIBRARY) \emph{impact factor} values confirm scholarly circulation:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Engineering Bulletin of the Don} — \textbf{RSCI IF: 0.342}. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}
  \item \emph{Science and Business: Development Ways} — \textbf{RSCI IF: 0.485} (2021). :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}
\end{itemize}
For the remaining journals, the official sites emphasize VAK inclusion and RSCI indexing; the numeric RSCI IF is available via their eLIBRARY profiles even when the number is not printed on the public site. \ExhibitRef{Vestnik_Web_Screenshot}\ExhibitRef{InnovationsInvestments_Web_Screenshot}\ExhibitRef{VKIT_Web_Screenshot}\ExhibitRef{CSTP_Web_Screenshot}
