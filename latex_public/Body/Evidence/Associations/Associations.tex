  Evidence of \mrls membership in associations in the field
  that require outstanding achievement of their members
}\label{subsec:Associations}

\subsubsection{Kazakhstan Information Security Association (KISA)}
\label{subsubsec:AssociationsKISA}

\SubSubSubSection{Proof of \mrl being a KISA member}
\mrl is a confirmed member of the \textbf{Kazakhstan Information Security Association (KISA)}.
This fact is evidenced by the official admission decision of July~1,~2025 (outgoing
No.~010725--2), signed by the Chair of KISA, Mr.~Viktor Pokusov, and sealed with the
association’s official stamp. The decision explicitly states:  
\emph{``approve and include Mr.~\mrl\ as a member of the community of information
security professionals''} \ExhibitRef{KaibAdmissionLetter}.  
This document is the authoritative proof of his admission into the professional body.

\SubSubSubSection{KISA as a professional association in the field of cybersecurity}
KISA is a national-level non-profit professional association uniting key organizations in
Kazakhstan’s information security sector. As described in the admission letter,  
KISA \emph{``unites approximately 30 organizations in the Republic of Kazakhstan working
directly in the sphere of information security''}, including:
\begin{itemize}
  \item National cybersecurity centers and accredited testing laboratories,
  \item Manufacturers of information protection tools,
  \item Universities and research institutions,
  \item Major operators of personal data \ExhibitRef{KaibAdmissionLetter}.
\end{itemize}

Its mission is also explicitly recorded in the admission decision:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{``Promote the development of the scientific school of information security,''}
  \item \emph{``Enhance the preparation of specialists and strengthen methodological frameworks,''}
  \item \emph{``Develop and improve legislation regarding information protection systems,''}
  \item \emph{``Support government agencies, enterprises, and organizations in implementing
        the national policy of the Republic of Kazakhstan in information security,''}
  \item \emph{``Form and expand a professional community in the field of information security''}
        \ExhibitRef{KaibAdmissionLetter}.
\end{itemize}

This demonstrates that KISA is not a generic professional group but an association that
operates squarely within the petitioner’s field of cybersecurity and information security.

\SubSubSubSection{Membership is granted only on the basis of outstanding professional achievements}
The admission decision specifies that the internal requirements for membership were reviewed
and satisfied by \mrl. These requirements go beyond education or payment of dues, and
explicitly involve the candidate’s significant record of accomplishments.  
The admission letter highlights that the Council’s decision was based on
\emph{``your work, significant experience, and professional achievements in IT,
cybersecurity, and project management''} \ExhibitRef{KaibAdmissionLetter}.

The enumerated achievement-based criteria include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Advanced technical education confirming expertise in IT, cybersecurity,
        systems architecture, digitalization, and innovation.
  \item \emph{``More than 10 years of professional and research experience, with at least 5 years
        in IT leadership positions.''}
  \item International project-management certifications (including Product Owner
        and Product Manager).
  \item Successful completion of advanced qualification examinations such as
        \emph{``Program Increment (PI) Planning, Leadership for PI Planning, Iteration Execution,
        and PI Execution.''}
  \item Written recommendations from recognized experts in IT and digitalization,
        confirming impeccable professional reputation.
  \item \emph{``Original and effective developments and methodologies in IT,
        innovation, and technology transfer.''}
  \item \emph{``Presentations delivered at national and international conferences''}
        (with international participation considered a distinct advantage) \ExhibitRef{KaibAdmissionLetter}.
\end{itemize}

As corroborating evidence that these requirements align with his profile, \mrl provides
his SAFe Product Owner / Product Manager (version~6.0) course completion certificate,
dated December~11,~2023, Certificate ID:~13095832--8742 \ExhibitRef{PMCertificate}.
This certificate supports the leadership and management achievements that were
part of the KISA admission requirements.

\SubSubSubSection{Membership decisions are judged by recognized experts}
The KISA admission letter explains that membership decisions are made by a formal vote of
the KISA Council. The Council is described as consisting of
\emph{``leading and professional experts in IT and cybersecurity, certified information
security officers, and project managers of national and international level''}
\ExhibitRef{KaibAdmissionLetter}.  
This shows that applications are assessed by a body of established, recognized experts in
the discipline of information security.

\SubSubSubSection{Public visibility and national standing of KISA}
Beyond the admission decision, publicly available evidence demonstrates that KISA plays
a distinguished role in Kazakhstan’s cybersecurity ecosystem:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{University–industry meetings.}  
  KISA representatives regularly participate in academic–employer councils on information
  security education and workforce needs. Photographs from these sessions confirm KISA’s
  involvement in shaping national curricula and training priorities \ExhibitRef{KISAMeeting}.
  
  \item \textbf{Public talks by KISA leadership.}  
  KISA Chair Viktor Pokusov delivered a widely publicized talk on
  \emph{``Information Security in Kazakhstan''}, evidencing his national-level
  subject-matter authority and the association’s leadership role in public discourse
  \ExhibitRef{PokusovTalk}.
  
  \item \textbf{National roundtables on cybersecurity.}  
  KISA has been a visible participant in national roundtables on cybersecurity issues
  in Astana. Reports note that KISA highlighted information-security trends,
  workforce shortages, and the importance of specialist training and certification
  \ExhibitRef{RoundTable}.
  
  \item \textbf{Official website presence.}  
  KISA maintains an independent national domain (\url{https://kisa.kz}), identifying itself as the
  Kazakhstan Information Security Association. Even while under scheduled maintenance, the
  website explicitly names the association and confirms its ongoing organizational activity
  \ExhibitRef{KISASite}.
\end{itemize}

Together, these records confirm that KISA is not a nominal or inactive group but a
recognized professional association with active participation in industry, academia,
and national cybersecurity policy.

\SubSubSubSection{Conclusion}

The evidence establishes that:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item KISA is a professional association operating directly in the field of
        cybersecurity and information security.
  \item Membership is granted only on the basis of significant professional achievements,
        as confirmed in the admission decision’s language that \mrl was admitted for his
        \emph{``work, significant experience, and professional achievements''}.
  \item Admission decisions are made by the KISA Council, which consists of recognized
        experts in IT and cybersecurity.
\end{enumerate}
In addition, external corroborating records demonstrate KISA’s visibility, national standing,
and leadership role in Kazakhstan’s information-security sector.  
Therefore, \mrl’s membership in KISA satisfies the evidentiary standard for membership in
associations that require outstanding achievements of their members, as judged by
recognized experts in the field.
