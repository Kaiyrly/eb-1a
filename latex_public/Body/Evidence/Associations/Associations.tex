% \textbf{Proof that Kazakhstan Information Security Association is a community in Mr. Taximov's field of endeavor}
The record and independent materials describe a national professional association in information security and information technology. It operates across Kazakhstan and unites organizations that work directly in digital systems and security.

% \textbf{Proof that outstanding achievements are required for membership}
The admission decision is on association letterhead and shows date, signature, stamp and outgoing number on the face of the record. It states that membership is granted for work, significant experience and professional achievements in information technology, cybersecurity and project management. It also lists objective prerequisites and confirms that admission is not automatic and is not based on payment of dues.
They include:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
 \item Advanced technical education confirming expertise in IT, cybersecurity, systems architecture, digitalization and innovation.
 \item More than 10 years of professional and research experience, with at least 5 years in IT leadership positions.
 \item International project-management certifications (including Product Owner and Product Manager).
 \item Successful completion of advanced qualification examinations such as Program Increment (PI) Planning, Leadership for PI Planning, Iteration Execution and PI Execution.
 \item Written recommendations from recognized experts in IT and digitalization, confirming impeccable professional reputation.
 \item Authorship of original and effective developments and methodologies in IT, innovation and technology transfer.
 \item Presentations delivered at national and international conferences.

The decision does not use the word “outstanding.” The level of achievement follows from the multifactor prerequisites, the documented record and the expert review that leads to selective admission.

%\textbf{Proof that applicants are judged by recognized national or international experts}
The letter says:
\emph{“A candidate is admitted by the decision of the Association Council. The Council consists of leading professional experts in information technology and cybersecurity, certified information security officers and project managers of national and international level.”} KISA Admission Decision (English translation).
The record identifies the decision-makers by name and title as shown in the decision and on the association roster, such as the Chair, Viktor Pokusov, and council members who hold national leadership roles in cybersecurity and IT. This shows that applicants are judged by recognized experts consistent with the regulatory standard for expert evaluation.
An official entry on the national portal Career.enbek.kz shows accreditation by the National Chamber of Entrepreneurs “Atameken” as a Center for Recognition of Professional Qualifications in information security and in information and communication technologies.

As stated in the letter:
\emph{“Functions include development of professional standards, standardized competency assessments with employer participation and certification of qualifications in core specialties of information security and information and communication technologies.”} Career.enbek.kz registry entry (English translation).
This confirms an expert evaluation function in the same field.
