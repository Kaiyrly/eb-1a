  Screenshot of the official website of the Kazakhstan Information Security Association (KISA),
  \url{https://kisa.kz}, confirming the association’s existence and recognized national standing.
  The website text (in Russian) states: \emph{``The site of the Kazakhstan Association of Information Security is currently being updated. Please visit later.''}
  This corroborates that KISA is an established, legally recognized professional body with its own
  independent national domain and infrastructure.
