  Official page of JSC “City Transportation Systems” (CTS) confirming that \textbf{all
  questions about public transport} should be submitted through the city’s Unified
  Contact Center “\textbf{iKOMEK},” and enumerating the same official channels:
  \textbf{109} short number, iKOMEK109 mobile app (AppStore/PlayMarket), the mayor’s
  official website, Telegram bot, Smart Astana app, and email \texttt{109@ikomekastana.kz}.
